Author: Ethan Olmsted
This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, Car.java,
which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class has the following:
• two instance variables
• a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
• getters for the instance variables in this class
• the toString method
• the equals method
• a copy method
